## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Iteration lifecycle logging
autocoder SHALL emit INFO-level log lines marking the start and end of each polling pass and each per-change iteration. The lines are intended for operator visibility in journalctl at the default log level (`RUST_LOG=info`), so an iteration that takes minutes is not silent.

#### Scenario: Polling pass start
- **WHEN** `run_pass_through_commits` begins (after workspace
  initialization and dirty-check have passed)
- **THEN** autocoder emits one INFO log line with the message
  `polling pass starting` and structured fields including `url`,
  `pending` (count of pending changes), and `waiting` (count of
  waiting changes)

#### Scenario: Polling pass end
- **WHEN** `run_pass_through_commits` returns Ok, regardless of
  whether any changes were processed
- **THEN** autocoder emits one INFO log line with the message
  `polling pass complete` and structured fields including `url`,
  `committed` (count of changes that produced commits this pass),
  and `waiting` (count of changes still in waiting state)
- **AND** the previous "polling pass produced no changes" line is
  removed (subsumed by the new uniform message)

#### Scenario: Per-change iteration start
- **WHEN** autocoder is about to invoke the executor on a pending
  change (or resume a waiting change with a human reply)
- **THEN** autocoder emits one INFO log line with the message
  `starting work on change` and structured fields including `url`
  and `change`

#### Scenario: Per-change iteration end
- **WHEN** `handle_outcome` (or the equivalent resume-path handler)
  returns for a change
- **THEN** autocoder emits one INFO log line with the message
  `change finished` and structured fields including `url`,
  `change`, and `outcome` (one of `archived`, `failed`,
  `escalated`, `ask_user_exit_early`)
