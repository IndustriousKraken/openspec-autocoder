## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Executor output persistence and visibility
The `ClaudeCliExecutor` SHALL persist every subprocess invocation's captured stdout and stderr to a per-change log file outside the workspace, and SHALL emit a WARN-level diagnostic tail when an exit-0 run produced no working-tree changes. This guarantees operators can root-cause "agent reported Completed without modifying the workspace" outcomes without re-running by hand.

#### Scenario: Persistent log file written on every run
- **WHEN** `ClaudeCliExecutor::run` completes a subprocess invocation
  (any outcome: success, non-zero, or timeout)
- **THEN** the captured stdout and stderr are written to
  `<system-temp>/autocoder-logs/<workspace-basename>/<change>.log`
  where `<workspace-basename>` is the last path component of the
  workspace and `<change>` is the change name
- **AND** the file format is plain text consisting of a
  `=== STDOUT (<n> bytes) ===` header, the verbatim stdout, a
  `=== STDERR (<m> bytes) ===` header, and the verbatim stderr
- **AND** any prior contents of that file are overwritten (the file
  represents the most recent run for that change)
- **AND** the parent directories are created on demand
- **AND** errors writing the log file are logged at WARN but do NOT
  fail the executor outcome (logging is best-effort)

#### Scenario: Inline tail logged on suspicious empty-workspace exit
- **WHEN** the subprocess exits 0 AND `git status --porcelain` is
  empty AND no AskUser marker (layer-1) was written AND no
  layer-2 clarification phrase was matched
- **THEN** the executor logs a single WARN-level message naming the
  change and including the trailing ~2KB of stdout and trailing
  ~2KB of stderr (whichever is shorter), so the operator can read
  the agent's apparent reasoning directly from `journalctl` without
  opening the per-change log file
- **AND** the message also includes the per-change log-file path so
  the operator can find the full output if the inline tail is
  truncated mid-thought
