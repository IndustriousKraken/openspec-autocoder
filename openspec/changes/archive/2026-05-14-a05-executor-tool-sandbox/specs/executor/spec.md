## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Tool-use sandbox is applied at every spawn
The CLI-wrapping executor backend SHALL apply tool-use restrictions to
every spawned child process via a per-iteration Claude Code settings
file derived from `executor.sandbox` config. The settings file is
generated in the OS temp directory (not the workspace), passed to
the spawned CLI via `--settings <path>`, and deleted after the child
exits.

#### Scenario: Default sandbox applies when block is absent
- **WHEN** `config.yaml` has no `executor.sandbox` block
- **THEN** at each `run` and `resume` invocation, the executor
  generates a temp Claude Code settings file containing the
  default-deny patterns for network commands and credential paths,
  AND spawns `claude` with `--settings <temp-path>
  --allowedTools <default-list> --permission-mode acceptEdits` as
  additional flags
- **AND** the default-deny list contains at minimum
  `Bash(curl:*)`, `Bash(wget:*)`, `Bash(ssh:*)`,
  `Bash(scp:*)`, `Bash(nc:*)`, `Bash(git push:*)`,
  `Bash(git remote *)`, `Read(/home/*/.ssh/**)`,
  `Read(/home/*/.claude/**)`

#### Scenario: Operator-customized sandbox is honored
- **WHEN** `config.yaml`'s `executor.sandbox` block explicitly lists
  `allowed_tools`, `disallowed_bash_patterns`, AND
  `disallowed_read_paths`
- **THEN** the generated settings file's `permissions.deny` contains
  exactly the operator's `Bash(...)` and `Read(...)` patterns
- **AND** the `--allowedTools` flag value is exactly the operator's
  `allowed_tools` list joined by commas
- **AND** no default values are merged in (operators express the
  full intended list)

#### Scenario: Partially-specified sandbox falls back to defaults per-field
- **WHEN** `executor.sandbox` is present but omits one of the three
  fields (e.g. specifies `allowed_tools` but not
  `disallowed_bash_patterns`)
- **THEN** the omitted field defaults to its safe baseline
- **AND** the specified field uses the operator's value verbatim

#### Scenario: Settings file is per-iteration and cleaned up
- **WHEN** the executor spawns the child
- **THEN** the settings file path is in the OS temp directory
  (`std::env::temp_dir()`), not inside the workspace
- **AND** the file is deleted after the child exits, regardless of
  exit status
- **AND** failure to delete the temp file is logged at warn level
  but does NOT propagate as an error

#### Scenario: Resume applies the same sandbox
- **WHEN** `Executor::resume(handle, answer)` spawns the child
- **THEN** the same sandbox-flag-and-settings-file generation runs,
  with the same defaults / operator config as the original `run`
  call

### Requirement: Sandbox config schema
autocoder SHALL accept an optional `executor.sandbox` block with
three optional sub-fields, each with a documented safe default
applied when absent.

#### Scenario: `allowed_tools` field
- **WHEN** `executor.sandbox.allowed_tools` is set
- **THEN** the value is a YAML list of Claude Code tool names (e.g.
  `["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Glob", "Grep", "Bash"]`)
- **AND** the value is passed verbatim to the `--allowedTools` flag
  joined by commas

#### Scenario: `disallowed_bash_patterns` field
- **WHEN** `executor.sandbox.disallowed_bash_patterns` is set
- **THEN** each entry becomes `Bash(<pattern>)` in the generated
  settings file's `permissions.deny` array

#### Scenario: `disallowed_read_paths` field
- **WHEN** `executor.sandbox.disallowed_read_paths` is set
- **THEN** each entry becomes `Read(<pattern>)` in the generated
  settings file's `permissions.deny` array

#### Scenario: Default `allowed_tools`
- **WHEN** `executor.sandbox.allowed_tools` is absent
- **THEN** the default is `["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Glob", "Grep", "Bash"]`
- **AND** notable exclusions are `WebFetch` and `WebSearch`

#### Scenario: Default `disallowed_bash_patterns`
- **WHEN** `executor.sandbox.disallowed_bash_patterns` is absent
- **THEN** the default includes at minimum: `curl:*`, `wget:*`,
  `nc:*`, `ncat:*`, `netcat:*`, `ssh:*`, `scp:*`, `sftp:*`,
  `rsync:*`, `git push:*`, `git remote *`, `git fetch *://*`

#### Scenario: Default `disallowed_read_paths`
- **WHEN** `executor.sandbox.disallowed_read_paths` is absent
- **THEN** the default includes at minimum: `/home/*/.ssh/**`,
  `/home/*/.claude/**`, `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/ssl/private/**`

### Requirement: Sandbox does not bind the code-reviewer
The tool-use sandbox SHALL apply only to the executor's spawned
agent CLI subprocess, NOT to the code-reviewer's LLM API calls. The
code-reviewer operates via direct HTTP requests under operator
configuration (provider, api_key, api_base_url, model) and is a
separate data flow.

#### Scenario: Reviewer call is unaffected by sandbox
- **WHEN** the code-reviewer is enabled AND
  `code_reviewer::review(diff, summary)` is called
- **THEN** the HTTP call to the configured LLM provider proceeds
  per the reviewer's config without consulting
  `executor.sandbox`
- **AND** the diff content (which the operator's reviewer config
  authorized for upload) is sent as configured

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: CLI-wrapping executor backend (`claude_cli`)
autocoder SHALL provide a concrete `Executor` implementation that wraps
an external command-line agent tool as a child process. The backend is
selected via `executor.kind: claude_cli` in the configuration. Every
spawn SHALL include the sandbox flags described under "Tool-use
sandbox is applied at every spawn".

#### Scenario: ClaudeCliExecutor instantiation
- **WHEN** autocoder initializes AND `executor.kind` is `claude_cli`
- **THEN** autocoder instantiates a `ClaudeCliExecutor` configured
  from `executor.command` (default `claude`), `executor.timeout_secs`
  (default 1800), and a resolved `ExecutorSandboxConfig` (operator
  value or per-field default)
- **AND** the executor is wrapped in `Arc<dyn Executor>` and shared
  across all spawned polling tasks

#### Scenario: Outcome mapping from CLI exit code
- **WHEN** `Executor::run(workspace, change)` is called
- **THEN** the executor generates the per-iteration sandbox settings
  file in a temp dir, then spawns the configured command as a tokio
  child process inside the workspace with the sandbox flags and
  the prompt on stdin
- **AND** on child exit code 0, the call returns
  `Ok(ExecutorOutcome::Completed)` (the executor does NOT inspect
  the workspace for diff)
- **AND** on non-zero child exit, the call returns
  `Ok(ExecutorOutcome::Failed { reason })` where `reason` contains
  the first 200 characters of captured stderr
- **AND** if the configured `executor.timeout_secs` elapses, the
  child process is killed and the call returns
  `Ok(ExecutorOutcome::Failed { reason: "timeout" })`
- **AND** the temp settings file is deleted after the child exits

#### Scenario: Resume not supported in this phase
- **WHEN** `Executor::resume(handle, answer)` is called on the
  foundation `ClaudeCliExecutor` (prior to the
  `chatops-escalation` change)
- **THEN** the call returns `Err(_)` whose text indicates resume
  is not supported until the `chatops-escalation` change retrofits
  real resume semantics
- **AND** no child process is spawned and no workspace state is
  modified

(Note: in the in-tree implementation today, `resume` is wired
through `chatops-escalation` already. This scenario reflects the
historical foundation-phase contract preserved for spec
continuity. The active `resume` path uses the same sandbox
generation as `run`, per the "Resume applies the same sandbox"
scenario above.)
