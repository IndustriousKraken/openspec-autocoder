## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Iteration-level error tolerance
The polling loop SHALL continue running after a failed iteration; a single iteration's error MUST NOT terminate the task or affect other repositories. Predictable failure categories (workspace init, mid-iteration dirty workspace, branch push, PR creation) SHALL emit a throttled chatops alert via the existing `AlertCategory` + `handle_predictable_failure` mechanism before the iteration returns `Err`.

#### Scenario: Iteration fails
- **WHEN** any error occurs during a polling iteration (workspace init, git operation, executor failure, PR creation)
- **THEN** the task emits a log line of the form `"polling iteration failed for <url>: <error chain>"` naming the failed step
- **AND** the task sleeps for `poll_interval_sec` and proceeds to the next iteration
- **AND** other repositories' polling tasks are unaffected (their iterations continue on schedule)

#### Scenario: Mid-iteration dirty workspace alerts via chatops
- **WHEN** `run_pass_through_commits` finds `git status --porcelain`
  non-empty at the start of a pass (after filtering autocoder
  bookkeeping files like `.alert-state.json`) AND chatops is
  configured AND `failure_alerts_enabled` is true
- **THEN** autocoder posts a throttled chatops notification under
  `AlertCategory::WorkspaceDirtyMidIteration` naming the repository
  URL and a short excerpt of the porcelain output
- **AND** the iteration returns the existing `Err` ("workspace ... is
  dirty before pass; refusing to proceed: ...")
- **AND** subsequent iterations that produce the same dirty state
  within 24 hours do NOT re-post (the per-category 24h throttle
  suppresses duplicates, matching the existing
  `WorkspaceInitFailure`/`BranchPushFailure`/`PrCreationFailure`
  behavior)

#### Scenario: Mid-iteration dirty workspace without chatops still logs
- **WHEN** the dirty-workspace condition above occurs AND chatops is
  not configured (or `failure_alerts_enabled` is false)
- **THEN** no chatops post is attempted
- **AND** the existing ERROR log line is the operator's sole signal
- **AND** the iteration still returns `Err` and the polling loop
  proceeds to the next sleep

#### Scenario: Dirty-workspace alert clears after recovery
- **WHEN** a subsequent iteration succeeds (workspace no longer
  dirty AND the pass produces commits AND push+PR steps both
  succeed)
- **THEN** the existing on-success `AlertState::clear` call clears
  the `WorkspaceDirtyMidIteration` throttle alongside every other
  category
- **AND** if the workspace becomes dirty again later, the next
  occurrence re-alerts immediately (no leftover suppression)
