## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: CLI-wrapping executor backend (`claude_cli`)
autocoder SHALL provide a concrete `Executor` implementation that wraps an external command-line agent tool as a child process. The backend is selected via `executor.kind: claude_cli` in the configuration. Every spawn SHALL include the sandbox flags described under "Tool-use sandbox is applied at every spawn". The executor SHALL build the implementer prompt by invoking `openspec instructions apply --change <name>` and substituting the result into the configured implementer template; if the invocation fails for any reason, the executor SHALL return Err so the iteration is marked Failed and retried — there is no raw-markdown fallback.

#### Scenario: ClaudeCliExecutor instantiation
- **WHEN** autocoder initializes AND `executor.kind` is `claude_cli`
- **THEN** autocoder instantiates a `ClaudeCliExecutor` configured
  from `executor.command` (default `claude`), `executor.timeout_secs`
  (default 1800), and a resolved `ExecutorSandboxConfig` (operator
  value or per-field default)
- **AND** the executor is wrapped in `Arc<dyn Executor>` and shared
  across all spawned polling tasks

#### Scenario: Outcome mapping from CLI exit code
- **WHEN** `Executor::run(workspace, change)` is called
- **THEN** the executor invokes `openspec instructions apply
  --change <change>` in the workspace and substitutes the resulting
  text into the implementer template at the `{{change_body}}`
  placeholder
- **AND** if `openspec instructions apply` cannot be spawned
  (binary not on PATH), exits non-zero, or returns empty stdout,
  the executor returns Err with a non-empty message naming the
  failure mode — the call does NOT return `Completed` or `Failed`,
  and does NOT fall back to raw-markdown concatenation
- **AND** on a successful prompt build, the executor generates the
  per-iteration sandbox settings file in a temp dir, then spawns
  the configured command as a tokio child process inside the
  workspace with the sandbox flags and the prompt on stdin
- **AND** on child exit code 0, the call returns
  `Ok(ExecutorOutcome::Completed)` (the executor does NOT inspect
  the workspace for diff)
- **AND** on non-zero child exit, the call returns
  `Ok(ExecutorOutcome::Failed { reason })` where `reason` contains
  the first 200 characters of captured stderr
- **AND** if the configured `executor.timeout_secs` elapses, the
  child process is killed and the call returns
  `Ok(ExecutorOutcome::Failed { reason: "timeout" })`
- **AND** the temp settings file is deleted after the child exits

#### Scenario: Resume not supported in this phase
- **WHEN** `Executor::resume(handle, answer)` is called on the
  foundation `ClaudeCliExecutor` (prior to the
  `chatops-escalation` change)
- **THEN** the call returns `Err(_)` whose text indicates resume
  is not supported until the `chatops-escalation` change retrofits
  real resume semantics
- **AND** no child process is spawned and no workspace state is
  modified

(Note: in the in-tree implementation today, `resume` is wired
through `chatops-escalation` already. This scenario reflects the
historical foundation-phase contract preserved for spec
continuity. The active `resume` path uses the same sandbox
generation as `run`, per the "Resume applies the same sandbox"
scenario above.)

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Implementer prompt template loading
The executor SHALL load an implementer prompt template at construction. The template wraps the openspec change content with a role-establishing imperative so the wrapped CLI knows it is acting as an autonomous implementer and not a chat assistant. The default template is compiled into the binary; deployments may override it by setting `executor.implementer_prompt_path` in `config.yaml` to a readable file path.

#### Scenario: Default template used when override is absent
- **WHEN** `executor.implementer_prompt_path` is unset in `config.yaml`
- **THEN** the executor uses the template compiled into the binary
  (sourced from `prompts/implementer.md` at build time)
- **AND** no filesystem access for the template occurs at runtime

#### Scenario: Override path is loaded at construction
- **WHEN** `executor.implementer_prompt_path` is set to a file path
- **THEN** the executor reads the file at construction (before the
  polling loop starts) and uses its contents as the template
- **AND** if the file is missing, unreadable, or empty, daemon
  startup fails with an error message naming the path

#### Scenario: Template substitution
- **WHEN** the executor renders the prompt for a change
- **THEN** every literal occurrence of `{{change_body}}` in the
  template is replaced with the output of
  `openspec instructions apply --change <change>`
- **AND** the rendered prompt is sent to the wrapped CLI on stdin
