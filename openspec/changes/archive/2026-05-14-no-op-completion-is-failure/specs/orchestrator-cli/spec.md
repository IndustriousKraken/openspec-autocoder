## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Reject archive-only iterations as Failed
autocoder SHALL treat an iteration as Failed (not Completed), revert the staged moves via `git reset --hard`, and leave the change pending for retry when the executor returns Completed AND the resulting working-tree changes consist *only* of file moves whose destination paths start with `openspec/changes/archive/`. The detection is structural — pattern-matching on rename destinations — and does not depend on which command produced the moves. autocoder SHALL also treat Completed-with-clean-workspace as Failed and leave the change pending for retry; the prior "archive without commit" handling is removed.

#### Scenario: Agent archives the change instead of implementing it
- **WHEN** the executor returns `Completed` for a change AND
  `git status --porcelain` reports a non-empty result AND every
  reported entry is a rename (status code `R`) whose target path
  begins with `openspec/changes/archive/`
- **THEN** autocoder reverts the working tree via
  `git reset --hard HEAD` to discard the staged moves
- **AND** autocoder treats the outcome as
  `Failed { reason: "agent appears to have archived without implementing the change" }`
- **AND** autocoder logs a `warn`-level line naming the change
- **AND** the change's `.in-progress` lock is removed via the
  existing Failed-handling code path so the next iteration
  retries

#### Scenario: Legitimate implementation that also moves an archive file
- **WHEN** the executor returns `Completed` AND the working tree
  contains at least one change that is NOT a rename into
  `openspec/changes/archive/` (e.g. modified `src/foo.rs`, added
  `tests/bar.rs`)
- **THEN** autocoder treats the outcome as Completed as before
- **AND** the commit + push + PR steps proceed normally
- **AND** archive-rename entries, if any, are included in the
  commit unchanged

#### Scenario: Workspace is clean (no changes at all)
- **WHEN** the executor returns `Completed` AND `git status
  --porcelain` is empty
- **THEN** autocoder treats the outcome as
  `Failed { reason: "agent reported Completed without modifying the workspace" }`
- **AND** autocoder logs a `warn`-level line naming the change
- **AND** autocoder does NOT commit, does NOT archive, and does
  NOT push
- **AND** the change's `.in-progress` lock is removed via the
  existing Failed-handling code path so the next iteration
  retries
- **AND** the lazy-archive detection does NOT fire (no staged
  moves to revert)
