## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Executor output persistence and visibility
The `ClaudeCliExecutor` SHALL persist every subprocess invocation's prompt, captured stdout, and captured stderr to a per-change log file outside the workspace, and SHALL emit a WARN-level diagnostic tail when an exit-0 run produced no working-tree changes. Additionally, `build_prompt` SHALL log a WARN naming the reason whenever it falls back to raw-markdown concatenation, so operators can distinguish "openspec succeeded" from each of the three silent-failure modes. This guarantees operators can root-cause "agent reported Completed without modifying the workspace" outcomes without re-running by hand.

#### Scenario: Persistent log file written on every run
- **WHEN** `ClaudeCliExecutor::run` completes a subprocess invocation
  (any outcome: success, non-zero, or timeout)
- **THEN** the prompt sent to the subprocess, the captured stdout, and
  the captured stderr are written to
  `<system-temp>/autocoder/logs/<workspace-basename>/<change>.log`
  where `<workspace-basename>` is the last path component of the
  workspace and `<change>` is the change name
- **AND** the file format is plain text consisting of a
  `=== PROMPT (<p> bytes) ===` header followed by the verbatim
  prompt, a `=== STDOUT (<n> bytes) ===` header followed by the
  verbatim stdout, and a `=== STDERR (<m> bytes) ===` header
  followed by the verbatim stderr
- **AND** any prior contents of that file are overwritten (the file
  represents the most recent run for that change)
- **AND** the parent directories are created on demand
- **AND** errors writing the log file are logged at WARN but do NOT
  fail the executor outcome (logging is best-effort)

#### Scenario: Inline tail logged on suspicious empty-workspace exit
- **WHEN** the subprocess exits 0 AND `git status --porcelain` is
  empty AND no AskUser marker (layer-1) was written AND no
  layer-2 clarification phrase was matched
- **THEN** the executor logs a single WARN-level message naming the
  change and including the trailing ~2KB of stdout and trailing
  ~2KB of stderr (whichever is shorter), so the operator can read
  the agent's apparent reasoning directly from `journalctl` without
  opening the per-change log file
- **AND** the message also includes the per-change log-file path so
  the operator can find the full output if the inline tail is
  truncated mid-thought

#### Scenario: build_prompt logs WARN on each fallback path
- **WHEN** `build_prompt` cannot use `openspec instructions apply`
  output for any reason
- **THEN** the executor logs a WARN naming the change and a
  structured `reason` field whose value is exactly one of:
  `openspec_not_found` (the `openspec` binary could not be spawned,
  typically because it is not on autocoder's PATH),
  `openspec_exited_nonzero` (the binary spawned but returned a
  non-zero exit status), or `openspec_empty_stdout` (the binary
  exited 0 but produced no stdout)
- **AND** in the `openspec_exited_nonzero` case the log also
  includes the exit code and a tail of stderr (up to 200 chars) to
  speed diagnosis
- **AND** `build_prompt` then proceeds with raw-markdown
  concatenation as before, returning a non-empty prompt or an Err
  if no change material exists

#### Scenario: Spawned child runs in its own process group
- **WHEN** `run_subprocess` spawns the wrapped CLI as a child
  process
- **THEN** the child is launched as the leader of a new process
  group via `pre_exec` calling `setsid()` (Unix), so the per-repo
  busy marker can record the child's PGID and the daemon can use
  `killpg(pgid, signal)` to terminate the entire subprocess tree
  (including any MCP servers spawned by the agent) if a stuck
  state is detected
- **AND** this has no effect on the executor's normal
  exit-mapping behavior; it only enables process-group signaling
  during stuck-state recovery
