# orchestrator-cli Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change orchestrator-architecture. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Daemon entry point
The orchestrator SHALL provide a `run` subcommand that loads a YAML configuration file and starts an asynchronous polling loop for each configured repository, terminating only on signal (SIGINT/SIGTERM) or fatal initialization error. In each polling iteration, the orchestrator SHALL process waiting (escalated) changes BEFORE pending (fresh) changes. If after the waiting-processing step ANY change in the same repository is still waiting, the orchestrator SHALL skip the pending-change loop for that iteration. This preserves the architecture's serial-queue invariant — pending changes are not processed while an earlier-or-equal change is unresolved. **The binary that exposes this subcommand is named `autocoder`; the full invocation is `autocoder run --config <path>`.**

#### Scenario: Iteration processes waiting changes before pending
- **WHEN** a polling iteration begins for a repository
- **THEN** the orchestrator first calls `queue::list_waiting(workspace)` and processes each waiting change in order
- **AND** only after all waiting changes have been processed does the orchestrator call `queue::list_pending(workspace)` and process pending changes

#### Scenario: Resuming a change after an answer arrives
- **WHEN** the orchestrator processes a waiting change AND `chatops_manager.poll_thread_for_human_reply` returns `Some(reply)`
- **THEN** the orchestrator (in this exact order) writes `.answer.json` containing the reply, reads `resume_handle` from `.question.json`, deletes `.question.json`, calls `executor.resume(resume_handle, &reply.text)`, and on any returned outcome deletes `.answer.json`
- **AND** the resumed call's outcome is handled identically to a fresh `executor.run` outcome: `Completed` ⇒ commit (if diff exists) and archive; `AskUser` ⇒ post a new question and write a fresh `.question.json` (after deleting `.answer.json`); `Failed` ⇒ log the reason naming the change

#### Scenario: Initial AskUser handling during pending iteration
- **WHEN** `executor.run` returns `Ok(ExecutorOutcome::AskUser { question, resume_handle })` during a pending-change iteration
- **THEN** the orchestrator calls `chatops_manager.post_question(channel, change, &question)` to obtain `thread_ts`, then writes `.question.json` containing the `thread_ts`, channel id, `resume_handle`, and current RFC3339 timestamp under key `asked_at`
- **AND** the orchestrator unlocks the change by removing `.in-progress`
- **AND** the change is NOT archived; it remains in the workspace and is enumerated by `list_waiting` on subsequent iterations
- **AND** the orchestrator proceeds to the next pending change

#### Scenario: Channel resolution per change
- **WHEN** the orchestrator needs the Slack channel id for a change
- **THEN** the orchestrator uses `repository.slack_channel_id` if set on the per-repo config
- **AND** otherwise uses `slack.default_channel_id` from the global config
- **AND** if neither is set, the AskUser handling fails with an error naming the missing config key

#### Scenario: Polling iteration does not block on a stuck waiting change
- **WHEN** a waiting change has not received a human reply
- **THEN** the iteration's processing of that change completes within one Slack polling round-trip (no internal sleep or retry loop)
- **AND** other waiting changes in the same repo continue to be polled in the same iteration

#### Scenario: Same-repo queue blocking when a change is still waiting
- **WHEN** an iteration completes the waiting-processing step AND `queue::list_waiting(workspace)` still returns a non-empty list
- **THEN** the orchestrator SHALL NOT call `queue::list_pending(workspace)` for that repository in this iteration
- **AND** the iteration emits a single log line of the form `"queue blocked for <url>: <N> change(s) still waiting on human reply"` listing the names
- **AND** other repositories' polling tasks are unaffected (cross-repo blocking is not implied)
- **AND** the iteration proceeds to its sleep step normally so a future iteration can re-check Slack

#### Scenario: Queue resumes after waiting set empties
- **WHEN** an iteration completes the waiting-processing step AND every previously-waiting change has either resumed-to-completion (archived) or resumed-to-Failed (returned to pending) AND `queue::list_waiting(workspace)` is now empty
- **THEN** the orchestrator proceeds to the pending-change loop in the same iteration
- **AND** any pending changes that were blocked in earlier iterations are eligible for processing now

### Requirement: Rewind subcommand
The orchestrator SHALL provide a `rewind` subcommand that recovers from a failed PR or bad implementation by unarchiving specified changes and resetting the relevant agent branch. The subcommand SHALL accept a `--repo <selector>` argument; the argument is required when the config contains multiple repositories AND optional (defaulting to the only configured repo) when the config contains exactly one. **The binary that exposes this subcommand is named `autocoder`; the full invocation is `autocoder rewind <change> --config <path> [--repo <selector>] [--hard]`.**

#### Scenario: Multi-repo rewind requires --repo
- **WHEN** the loaded config contains 2 or more repositories AND the user invokes `autocoder rewind <change> --config <path>` without `--repo`
- **THEN** the process exits non-zero within 5 seconds
- **AND** stderr names the missing argument AND lists the configured repositories' short names as candidate selectors

#### Scenario: Single-repo rewind defaults to the only repo
- **WHEN** the loaded config contains exactly one repository AND `--repo` is omitted
- **THEN** the process operates against that repository's workspace without prompting for the selector
- **AND** a log line at start of execution names the repository being rewound

#### Scenario: Selector resolution by URL or short-name
- **WHEN** `--repo <selector>` is provided
- **THEN** the orchestrator attempts to match the selector against each configured repository's full URL (exact string equality) AND against a derived short-name (the URL's basename with any `.git` suffix removed)
- **AND** if exactly one repository matches, the rewind proceeds against that repo
- **AND** if zero repositories match, the process exits non-zero with stderr naming the unmatched selector and listing the available short-names
- **AND** if two or more repositories match (ambiguous selector), the process exits non-zero with stderr naming all matching repository URLs

#### Scenario: Soft rewind requires confirmation
- **WHEN** the user invokes rewind WITHOUT `--hard` (after selector resolution)
- **THEN** the process prints to stderr the line `This will delete branch '<agent_branch>' (local) and unarchive <N> change(s) (<comma-separated names>). Proceed? [y/N]`
- **AND** reads one line from stdin
- **AND** if the trimmed input is not exactly `y` or `Y`, the process logs `rewind cancelled` and exits with status 0 without modifying any branch or archive state

#### Scenario: Hard rewind deletes the agent branch locally and remotely
- **WHEN** the user invokes rewind WITH `--hard`
- **THEN** the process skips the confirmation prompt
- **AND** runs `git branch -D <agent_branch>` against the resolved repository's workspace
- **AND** runs `git push origin --delete <agent_branch>` against the resolved repository's workspace
- **AND** if remote deletion fails because the remote branch does not exist, the failure is logged at debug level and rewind proceeds; other remote-deletion failures (auth, network) are logged at error level but do NOT halt unarchive

#### Scenario: Unarchive of multiple changes
- **WHEN** the user passes two or more change names to rewind
- **THEN** the process attempts unarchive for each in command-line order
- **AND** if any individual unarchive fails (no matching archive entry, destination collision), the process continues with the remaining changes
- **AND** at the end, if any unarchive failed, the process exits non-zero with stderr listing the failed changes and their reasons; otherwise it exits 0 with a summary log line naming all rewound changes

### Requirement: Per-repository asynchronous polling loop
autocoder SHALL implement the per-repository polling task referenced in `orchestrator-architecture/specs/orchestrator-cli/spec.md` as a sleep-then-iterate cycle that runs the architecture's single-pass workflow on every iteration.

#### Scenario: Spawn count matches config
- **WHEN** the daemon starts with a config containing N repositories AND the workspace collision check passes
- **THEN** exactly N polling tasks are spawned via `tokio::task::JoinSet`
- **AND** each task owns its own workspace path (no two tasks share a path; collision detection at startup enforces non-overlap)

#### Scenario: Normal iteration
- **WHEN** a polling task wakes (start of process or end of previous sleep)
- **THEN** it runs the full single-pass workflow for its repository: workspace init → stale-lock cleanup → dirty-workspace refusal → branch recreation → queue walk → push and PR creation if any commits were produced
- **AND** the task then sleeps for `poll_interval_sec` before iterating again
- **AND** no two iterations within the same task overlap

#### Scenario: Iteration runtime exceeds poll interval
- **WHEN** an iteration's wall-clock runtime exceeds `poll_interval_sec`
- **THEN** the next iteration begins immediately after the current one finishes
- **AND** no negative sleep is attempted; no two iterations within the same task run in parallel

### Requirement: Iteration-level error tolerance
The polling loop SHALL continue running after a failed iteration; a single iteration's error MUST NOT terminate the task or affect other repositories.

#### Scenario: Iteration fails
- **WHEN** any error occurs during a polling iteration (workspace init, git operation, executor failure, PR creation)
- **THEN** the task emits a log line of the form `"polling iteration failed for <url>: <error chain>"` naming the failed step
- **AND** the task sleeps for `poll_interval_sec` and proceeds to the next iteration
- **AND** other repositories' polling tasks are unaffected (their iterations continue on schedule)

### Requirement: Graceful shutdown on signal
autocoder SHALL respond to SIGINT or SIGTERM by cancelling all polling tasks; each task completes its current iteration (if any) and exits cleanly.

#### Scenario: Signal during inter-iteration sleep
- **WHEN** SIGINT or SIGTERM arrives while every polling task is sleeping
- **THEN** every task exits its sleep within 200 ms (verified in tests via the `CancellationToken` selecting against the sleep) and does not begin another iteration
- **AND** the main process exits within 30 seconds total

#### Scenario: Signal during iteration
- **WHEN** SIGINT or SIGTERM arrives while a polling iteration is in progress
- **THEN** the in-flight iteration runs to completion (mid-iteration cancellation is NOT performed); the task then observes the cancellation token and exits without sleeping or starting another iteration
- **AND** any child processes spawned by the iteration receive their normal lifecycle (the executor's child process completes or hits its own `executor.timeout_secs`)

### Requirement: Startup logging per repository
autocoder SHALL emit a startup log line per configured repository naming its URL, derived (or explicit) workspace path, and configured `poll_interval_sec`.

#### Scenario: Startup line emitted
- **WHEN** the daemon starts AND the workspace collision check passes
- **THEN** before any polling task begins iterating, autocoder emits one log line per repository containing the literal URL, the resolved workspace path, and the integer `poll_interval_sec`

### Requirement: Per-owner GitHub token routing
autocoder SHALL resolve the GitHub PAT used for each PR-creation call by
parsing the repository URL's owner segment and consulting an optional
`owner_tokens` map in the `github:` config block. Map values MAY be
either a bare string (interpreted as an env var name) or
`{ value: "..." }` (interpreted as an inline secret). When no
owner-specific entry matches, autocoder SHALL fall back in priority
order to `github.token` (inline, when set) then to the env var named by
`github.token_env`. When neither route resolves, autocoder SHALL fail
at startup before any polling task is spawned.

#### Scenario: Owner-specific token used when configured (env var name)
- **WHEN** `config.yaml`'s `github.owner_tokens` map contains an entry
  whose key matches the URL owner of a configured repository
  (case-insensitive) AND the value is a bare string
- **THEN** the PR-creation HTTP call for that repository uses the value
  of the environment variable named by `owner_tokens[<matched-key>]`
- **AND** if that environment variable is unset at startup, autocoder
  exits non-zero with stderr naming both the owner and the missing env
  var

#### Scenario: Owner-specific token used when configured (inline)
- **WHEN** `config.yaml`'s `github.owner_tokens` map contains an entry
  whose key matches the URL owner of a configured repository
  (case-insensitive) AND the value is `{ value: "..." }`
- **THEN** the PR-creation HTTP call for that repository uses the
  inline `value` verbatim
- **AND** no environment variable is consulted for that owner

#### Scenario: Fallback to inline global token
- **WHEN** `owner_tokens` does not match the repository's owner AND
  `github.token` is set
- **THEN** the PR-creation HTTP call uses the inline value verbatim
- **AND** `github.token_env` is NOT consulted; if both
  `github.token` and `github.token_env`'s named env var are set,
  autocoder emits exactly one `warn`-level log line at startup noting
  that the inline value takes precedence

#### Scenario: Fallback to env-var global token
- **WHEN** `owner_tokens` does not match the repository's owner AND
  `github.token` is unset
- **THEN** the PR-creation HTTP call uses the value of the environment
  variable named by `github.token_env`
- **AND** if `github.token_env`'s named environment variable is unset,
  autocoder exits non-zero with stderr naming the missing env var AND
  the repository whose owner has no `owner_tokens` route

#### Scenario: Startup logs name the source per repository
- **WHEN** autocoder starts and successfully resolves a token route for
  every configured repository
- **THEN** for each repository, autocoder emits an info-level log line
  of the form `repository <url> will use GitHub token from <source>`
- **AND** `<source>` is `env var <name>` for env-var resolution, or
  `inline (<field-path>)` for inline resolution, with `<field-path>`
  being one of `github.token`, `github.owner_tokens[<owner>]`, or the
  env-var name path
- **AND** the log line NEVER contains the secret value itself

#### Scenario: Case-insensitive owner matching
- **WHEN** `owner_tokens` contains a key like `My-Org` AND a repository
  URL has owner `my-org`
- **THEN** the entry matches and its resolved secret (env-var or
  inline) is used
- **AND** the same applies in reverse (config key `my-org`, URL owner
  `My-Org`)

#### Scenario: Backward compatibility — config with only `token_env`
- **WHEN** `config.yaml` has a `github:` block with `token_env` set AND
  no `owner_tokens` key AND no `token` key
- **THEN** every repository uses the env var named by `token_env`, with
  no behavior change from the prior single-token implementation

### Requirement: SecretSource accepts inline values
autocoder SHALL define a `SecretSource` enum with two variants:
`EnvVar(String)` (deserialized from a bare YAML string, interpreted as
an env var name) and `Inline { value: String }` (deserialized from a
YAML object of shape `{ value: "..." }`, interpreted as the secret
value verbatim). The enum SHALL expose a `resolve(field_label)` method
that returns the secret value or an error naming the originating field.

#### Scenario: Bare string parses as EnvVar
- **WHEN** a YAML field declared as `SecretSource` contains a bare
  string (`my_field: GITHUB_TOKEN`)
- **THEN** serde deserializes it as `SecretSource::EnvVar("GITHUB_TOKEN".into())`
- **AND** `resolve` reads the env var of that name; on miss, returns an
  error whose text contains the env var name AND the field label

#### Scenario: Object parses as Inline
- **WHEN** a YAML field declared as `SecretSource` contains
  `my_field: { value: "abc123" }`
- **THEN** serde deserializes it as `SecretSource::Inline { value: "abc123".into() }`
- **AND** `resolve` returns `"abc123"` directly without consulting the
  environment

#### Scenario: Invalid shape produces an intelligible error
- **WHEN** a YAML field declared as `SecretSource` contains a list, a
  number, or an object without a `value` key
- **THEN** `Config::load_from` returns an error mentioning the field
  whose value could not be parsed

### Requirement: `github.fork_owner` opt-in to fork-PR mode
autocoder SHALL accept an optional `github.fork_owner: String` field in
`config.yaml`. When present, autocoder operates in **fork-PR mode** for
all configured repositories: the agent branch is pushed to a fork
owned by `fork_owner`, and PRs are opened as cross-repository PRs from
the fork to the upstream. When absent, autocoder operates in
**direct-push mode** with no behavior change from the prior
implementation.

#### Scenario: `fork_owner` absent — direct-push mode
- **WHEN** `config.yaml` has no `github.fork_owner` key
- **THEN** every configured repository operates in direct-push mode:
  the agent branch is pushed to `origin` and PRs use the agent-branch
  name as the `head` parameter
- **AND** no `fork` remote is registered in any workspace

#### Scenario: `fork_owner` present — fork-PR mode active
- **WHEN** `config.yaml` has `github.fork_owner: <handle>` set
- **THEN** every configured repository operates in fork-PR mode: the
  agent branch is pushed to the `fork` remote (pointing at
  `git@github.com:<handle>/<repo>.git` or the HTTPS equivalent), and
  PRs are opened with `head: "<handle>:<agent-branch>"` against the
  upstream repository

#### Scenario: `fork_owner` is global, not per-repository
- **WHEN** `config.yaml` has `github.fork_owner: <handle>` set
- **THEN** the same `<handle>` is used as the fork owner for every
  configured repository
- **AND** per-repository fork-owner overrides are NOT supported

### Requirement: Startup verification of fork existence
When `github.fork_owner` is set, autocoder SHALL ensure each configured
repository has a reachable fork at the derived URL before spawning any
polling task. Forks that are missing or unreachable SHALL be created
automatically via `POST /repos/{upstream-owner}/{upstream-repo}/forks`
using the PAT resolved for the upstream owner; the daemon then polls
the fork URL via `git ls-remote` until it becomes reachable or until a
60-second timeout elapses. If creation fails (non-2xx) OR polling
times out, autocoder SHALL aggregate the failures into a single
startup error and exit non-zero before any polling task is spawned.

#### Scenario: All forks already exist
- **WHEN** autocoder starts with `github.fork_owner` set AND every
  configured repository's derived fork URL resolves via
  `git ls-remote <fork-url> HEAD` on the first probe
- **THEN** no fork-creation API calls are issued
- **AND** all polling tasks are spawned and the daemon enters its
  normal polling state

#### Scenario: A fork is missing and creation succeeds
- **WHEN** autocoder starts with `github.fork_owner` set AND at least
  one configured repository's derived fork URL fails the initial
  `git ls-remote` probe
- **THEN** autocoder issues `POST /repos/<upstream-owner>/<upstream-repo>/forks`
  with header `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (token resolved by the
  existing per-owner routing) for each missing fork
- **AND** on 2xx response from the POST, autocoder polls the fork URL
  via `git ls-remote` every 2 seconds for up to 60 seconds
- **AND** when polling succeeds, the daemon proceeds to spawn polling
  tasks normally
- **AND** the daemon emits one info-level log line per created fork
  of the form `created fork <fork-url> from upstream <upstream-url>`

#### Scenario: Fork-creation POST fails
- **WHEN** autocoder attempts to create a missing fork AND the
  `POST /repos/{upstream-owner}/{upstream-repo}/forks` call returns a
  non-2xx status code
- **THEN** that repository's failure is recorded with the upstream
  URL, the expected fork URL, and the HTTP status (plus a body snippet
  truncated to 200 chars)
- **AND** autocoder continues attempting the remaining repositories'
  forks before aggregating failures
- **AND** after all repositories are processed, if any failed,
  autocoder exits non-zero with a single error listing every failed
  repo

#### Scenario: Fork-creation succeeds but the fork is not yet reachable
- **WHEN** the POST returns 2xx AND `git ls-remote <fork-url> HEAD`
  fails for 60 seconds of polling at 2-second intervals
- **THEN** that repository's failure is recorded as
  "fork creation succeeded but the fork at `<fork-url>` was not
  reachable within 60s"
- **AND** the failure is included in the aggregated startup error
  (the daemon does NOT proceed with this repo missing)

#### Scenario: A fork already exists when creation is attempted
- **WHEN** autocoder issues the fork-creation POST AND the upstream
  has already been forked to the destination user
- **THEN** the GitHub API returns 2xx with the existing fork's
  metadata (idempotent behavior)
- **AND** autocoder treats this as success and proceeds with the
  reachability probe normally

### Requirement: Rewind --hard targets fork remote in fork-PR mode
autocoder SHALL delete the agent branch from the `fork` remote (not
`origin`) when `rewind` is invoked with `--hard` AND
`github.fork_owner` is set. The local-branch deletion semantics are
unchanged.

#### Scenario: Hard rewind in fork-PR mode
- **WHEN** the operator runs `autocoder rewind <change> --hard` AND
  `github.fork_owner` is set
- **THEN** the manager runs
  `git push fork --delete <agent_branch>` instead of
  `git push origin --delete <agent_branch>`
- **AND** the local branch is deleted via `git branch -D <agent_branch>`
  as in direct-push mode
- **AND** failures of the remote delete are logged but non-blocking,
  as in direct-push mode

#### Scenario: Soft rewind in fork-PR mode
- **WHEN** the operator runs `autocoder rewind <change>` (no `--hard`)
  AND `github.fork_owner` is set
- **THEN** the manager deletes only the local branch; neither remote
  is touched
- **AND** the resulting fork's agent branch is left intact for the
  next polling pass to force-push over

### Requirement: Dirty workspace auto-recovers at startup
autocoder SHALL attempt automatic recovery before falling back to the existing "skip for the process lifetime" behavior when a repository's workspace is dirty at startup (non-empty `git status --porcelain` output). Recovery consists of `git checkout <base_branch>`, `git reset --hard origin/<base_branch>`, and `git clean -fd`. After recovery, autocoder SHALL re-run the dirty check; if clean, the repository proceeds to normal polling.

#### Scenario: Workspace dirty due to prior failed iteration
- **WHEN** a repository's workspace has uncommitted changes at
  startup (residue from a previous executor run that crashed or
  was killed mid-iteration)
- **THEN** autocoder logs a `warn`-level line naming the dirty
  entry count and indicating recovery is being attempted
- **AND** autocoder runs `git checkout <base_branch>`, then
  `git reset --hard origin/<base_branch>`, then `git clean -fd`
  in the workspace
- **AND** autocoder re-runs `git status --porcelain`; if empty,
  logs `info` "workspace recovered" and the repository proceeds
  to normal polling

#### Scenario: Workspace remains dirty after recovery attempt
- **WHEN** the recovery commands all complete but a subsequent
  `git status --porcelain` is still non-empty (gitignored state,
  read-only mount, file-locking, etc.)
- **THEN** autocoder logs the existing skip-for-lifetime error
  message
- **AND** the repository is skipped for the process lifetime,
  preserving the prior conservative behavior for genuinely
  unrecoverable cases

#### Scenario: Workspace already clean
- **WHEN** the initial `git status --porcelain` is empty
- **THEN** no recovery commands are executed
- **AND** the repository proceeds to normal polling, identical
  to prior behavior

### Requirement: Reject archive-only iterations as Failed
autocoder SHALL treat an iteration as Failed (not Completed), revert the staged moves via `git reset --hard`, and leave the change pending for retry when the executor returns Completed AND the resulting working-tree changes consist *only* of file moves whose destination paths start with `openspec/changes/archive/`. The detection is structural — pattern-matching on rename destinations — and does not depend on which command produced the moves. autocoder SHALL also treat Completed-with-clean-workspace as Failed and leave the change pending for retry; the prior "archive without commit" handling is removed.

#### Scenario: Agent archives the change instead of implementing it
- **WHEN** the executor returns `Completed` for a change AND
  `git status --porcelain` reports a non-empty result AND every
  reported entry is a rename (status code `R`) whose target path
  begins with `openspec/changes/archive/`
- **THEN** autocoder reverts the working tree via
  `git reset --hard HEAD` to discard the staged moves
- **AND** autocoder treats the outcome as
  `Failed { reason: "agent appears to have archived without implementing the change" }`
- **AND** autocoder logs a `warn`-level line naming the change
- **AND** the change's `.in-progress` lock is removed via the
  existing Failed-handling code path so the next iteration
  retries

#### Scenario: Legitimate implementation that also moves an archive file
- **WHEN** the executor returns `Completed` AND the working tree
  contains at least one change that is NOT a rename into
  `openspec/changes/archive/` (e.g. modified `src/foo.rs`, added
  `tests/bar.rs`)
- **THEN** autocoder treats the outcome as Completed as before
- **AND** the commit + push + PR steps proceed normally
- **AND** archive-rename entries, if any, are included in the
  commit unchanged

#### Scenario: Workspace is clean (no changes at all)
- **WHEN** the executor returns `Completed` AND `git status
  --porcelain` is empty
- **THEN** autocoder treats the outcome as
  `Failed { reason: "agent reported Completed without modifying the workspace" }`
- **AND** autocoder logs a `warn`-level line naming the change
- **AND** autocoder does NOT commit, does NOT archive, and does
  NOT push
- **AND** the change's `.in-progress` lock is removed via the
  existing Failed-handling code path so the next iteration
  retries
- **AND** the lazy-archive detection does NOT fire (no staged
  moves to revert)

### Requirement: Startup preflight for openspec availability
autocoder SHALL verify that the `openspec` binary is available before the polling loop starts. A failed preflight aborts daemon startup with a non-zero exit code, ensuring a misconfigured deployment fails loudly instead of looping forever producing nothing.

#### Scenario: openspec is available
- **WHEN** the daemon starts and `Command::new("openspec").arg("--version")` exits 0
- **THEN** the preflight passes and the polling loop starts normally

#### Scenario: openspec binary not on PATH
- **WHEN** the daemon starts and spawning `openspec --version`
  returns a `NotFound` I/O error
- **THEN** the daemon exits non-zero before the polling loop starts
- **AND** stderr names the failure: `openspec preflight failed:
  binary not found on PATH. Install openspec and ensure the
  systemd unit's PATH covers its install directory.`

#### Scenario: openspec spawns but exits non-zero
- **WHEN** the daemon starts, `openspec --version` spawns
  successfully, but exits non-zero
- **THEN** the daemon exits non-zero before the polling loop starts
- **AND** stderr names the exit code and includes a tail of
  `openspec --version`'s stderr output (up to 200 chars)

### Requirement: Iteration lifecycle logging
autocoder SHALL emit INFO-level log lines marking the start and end of each polling pass and each per-change iteration. The lines are intended for operator visibility in journalctl at the default log level (`RUST_LOG=info`), so an iteration that takes minutes is not silent.

#### Scenario: Polling pass start
- **WHEN** `run_pass_through_commits` begins (after workspace
  initialization and dirty-check have passed)
- **THEN** autocoder emits one INFO log line with the message
  `polling pass starting` and structured fields including `url`,
  `pending` (count of pending changes), and `waiting` (count of
  waiting changes)

#### Scenario: Polling pass end
- **WHEN** `run_pass_through_commits` returns Ok, regardless of
  whether any changes were processed
- **THEN** autocoder emits one INFO log line with the message
  `polling pass complete` and structured fields including `url`,
  `committed` (count of changes that produced commits this pass),
  and `waiting` (count of changes still in waiting state)
- **AND** the previous "polling pass produced no changes" line is
  removed (subsumed by the new uniform message)

#### Scenario: Per-change iteration start
- **WHEN** autocoder is about to invoke the executor on a pending
  change (or resume a waiting change with a human reply)
- **THEN** autocoder emits one INFO log line with the message
  `starting work on change` and structured fields including `url`
  and `change`

#### Scenario: Per-change iteration end
- **WHEN** `handle_outcome` (or the equivalent resume-path handler)
  returns for a change
- **THEN** autocoder emits one INFO log line with the message
  `change finished` and structured fields including `url`,
  `change`, and `outcome` (one of `archived`, `failed`,
  `escalated`, `ask_user_exit_early`)
